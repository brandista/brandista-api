"""Canonical platform JWT primitives.

This module owns the v2 token contract end-to-end: model, encode, decode,
and DB-side provisioning. Endpoints in app/routers/auth_v2.py are thin
wrappers that call helpers here.

Token shape (per spec §4):
    {
      "sub":    "<user-uuid>",
      "email":  "<email>",
      "org_id": "<org-uuid>",
      "role":   "<role>",
      "jti":    "<random-uuid>",
      "iat":    <unix-ts>,
      "exp":    <unix-ts>
